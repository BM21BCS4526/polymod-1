**Building with Polygon Bridge**

In this project, I've set up an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain and used the Polygon Bridge to transfer assets. 

**Description**

Firstly I have generated AI-based images for NFT transfer in this project. Then created a smart contract MetaToken.sol and deployed it on the goerli network.
Minted the nfts, approved and deposited these nfts and lastly created getBalnace.js for getting the balance of the token generated on the Mumbai network.
